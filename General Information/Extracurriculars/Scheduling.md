### Schedules and You
Over the course of your time here at Strixhaven University, time management will be an important skill. Each week is divided up into a 7-day cycle, where the first 5 days are considered weekdays, and the last 2 are considered weekends.

In order to efficiently manage your time, characters are allowed to choose what to do with their time. Events, such as working a job, participating in a club, spending time with another student, etc. will all take up a single "time-slot". Studying takes up two "time-slots".

During the day during weekdays, students are expected to attend classes or labs. Therefore, students have two "time-slots" on weekdays unless they choose to skip classes. In this case, days where a student chooses to skip classes is considered to have three "time-slots" for that day.

During the weekends, students have a lot more free-time, and therefore are allocated three "time-slots" per weekend day.

Students can consume caffeine in order to gain another "time-slot" for any day. However, gaining additional "time-slots" in this manner is dangerous. For each "time-slot" gained in this manner after the first, a student gains one level of exhaustion. This limit is reset every week.
