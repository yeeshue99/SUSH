[[Lianna Flametongue]] puts potential Dragonsguard recruits through their paces in this club. Students work through a number of training drills and focus on various attack techniques that have been used by the Dragonsguard for centuries to protect Arcavios. On special weekend trips students might travel to meet and learn from individual Founder Dragons.
