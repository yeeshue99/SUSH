For the most part students who wish to play a musical instrument join this club. Some students may form smaller, independent musical groups but most jump at the chance to join [[Zaffai, Thunder Conductor|Zaffai's]] Show Band. Most weekday sessions are spent in rehearsals with performances taking place between one to three times each year.
