In this club, sponsored by Dramitia, students rehearse and perform both classics and student-written comedies and dramas. Performances tend to happen around once a trimester. Dramitia attempts to keep out of her student's affairs to allow for directorial talents to flourish as she once did but she's only too happy to step in to lend a hand if asked.
