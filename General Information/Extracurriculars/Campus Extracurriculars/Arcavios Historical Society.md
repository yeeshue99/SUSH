Members of this club meet over snacks and a cup of tea to discuss the events of the past. Debates often break out when research findings about historical events differ between students. Students are graced each trimester with a bonus lecture from sponsor [[Riri Brighteye]]. While some students would typically groan and moan about having additional lectures, students in this club look forward to the lectures each time.
