Religion at Strixhaven is treated with reverence as students come from many walks of life and students tend to not want to offend their peers. Club members in this group consist of faithful practitioners and curious individuals alike. Students take part in enlightened discussions and debates under the mediation of Professor Helioz. This group might work with the Event Planning Committee to host various holiday celebrations throughout the year.
