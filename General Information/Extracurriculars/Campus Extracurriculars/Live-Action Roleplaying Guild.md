Some professors sponsor clubs but tend to not get involved too often. Professor Rixy is involved in every single club meeting and her students love her for it. Rixy is well known for using her abilities as a changeling to take on both villainous and heroic roles in this club. While the club doesn't have special events they do have open events that take place campus wide for students who want to partake without officially joining the club.
