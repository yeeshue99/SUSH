Hitting a target 10 feet away with a spell is a feat any first-year can achieve. Hitting a target 120 feet away behind a decent amount of cover is much more difficult. Students in this club, sponsored by Liv Brandford, train to hit difficult targets behind different types of cover and at different ranges. Competitions take place each trimester.
