Students looking to build muscle and push their boundaries come together in this club. Using specially made and standardized weights made of iron, these students typically train together in the evening before competing once a year in a large meet that is sponsored by [[Rock, a.k.a. Earsplitter|Professor Rock]]. Overall winners from different categories may receive cash prizes.
