**Associated Rolls: Arcana, Constitution Saves, Spell Modifier**

Students in this club are self-named followers of [[Tivash, Gloom Summoner|Professor Tivash]]. They are few in number and invitations are typically handled by word of mouth or referrals from Tivash himself rather than through public advertisements. Students in the club work together to unravel dark, borderline forbidden magics as they work to try to get to the level of power their hero has. The club functions almost less as a club and as more of a cult, one Tivash acknowledges but doesn't necessarily help. Because he is technically listed as their sponsor he gets out of having to deal with more annoying students and because they are trying to independently reach his level he has more time to do his own studying and research into dark powers. This group has no special weekend events.
