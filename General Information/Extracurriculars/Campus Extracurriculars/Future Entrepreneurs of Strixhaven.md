Some mages want to make new discoveries. Others want to better their communities. But for students in this club, magic is a means to an end and that end is profit. Club members work on making different products and on carrying out marketing campaigns. The Battle of Strixhaven is the perfect event for them to set up and hawk their wares as students and faculty from across the campus are gathered in a single spot.
