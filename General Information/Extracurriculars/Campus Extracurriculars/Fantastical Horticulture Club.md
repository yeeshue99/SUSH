Verooja is far too protective to allow students in his garden without constant supervision. So he set aside a side plot of land in Sedgemoor for this sponsored club. Students work together to grow and cultivate a number of uncommon or unique plants. Verooja takes students through portals from time to time to different parts of Arcavios to expose them to interesting plants from different biomes.
