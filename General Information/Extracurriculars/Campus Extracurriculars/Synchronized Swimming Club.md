This club is sponsored by the ultimate synchronized swimmers, [[Adrix and Nev, Twincasters|Adrix and Nev]]. Students learn not only how to master swimming through the water but how to match the rhythm and timing of others to create truly amazing displays of art that involve incredibly natural patterns. Most sessions are filled with intense training but the club puts on a public show at least once a year, typically towards the end of the year.
