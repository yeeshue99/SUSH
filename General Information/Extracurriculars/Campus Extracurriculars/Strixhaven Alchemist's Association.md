**Associated Skills: Arcana, Medicine, Nature**

This club focuses primarily on the power of potions. Students have their own space in Professor Asana's lab where they mix various ingredients and note the interactions that take place. Particularly skilled students may be offered a student job by Asana to work as a clinic assistant. This club has no special events that take place on the weekend.
