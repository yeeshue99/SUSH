*Neutral Good Merfolk First Year (Prismari)*

Iya is a forthright soul, never one to mince her words when the unvarnished truth gets straight to the point. This would be an intolerable trait in anyone other than Iya, who seldom has a dark thought about anyone who hasn’t purposefully tried to cause her trouble. She is fascinated by the many fashions borne by the students and faculty of Strixhaven, with many a passerby being questioned about the origin of their clothing or complimented on their sense of style. 
Iya was gently caroused to joining the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, which she took to like a merfolk to water. Working as a book shelver may not seem as natural a fit for Iya, but reading through the Biblioplex’s titles provides her muse with many sources of inspiration.

**Bond Boon.** You never have to worry about what to wear or how to accessorize, as Iya or one of her friends will have something suitable to hand.
**Bond Bane.** Both students and faculty will openly criticize you on your choice of attire or makeup, even during extracurricular and public events.
