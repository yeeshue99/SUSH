*Chaotic Good Dwarf First Year (Lorehold)*
Greta is often heard long before she is seen, as her raucous laughter echoes through the university’s halls. Enjoying a reputation as a golden-hearted troublemaker, Greta hates studying and grumbles about it at length. This has led to numerous warnings from the librarians for unnecessarily loud behavior. much to Greta's amusement. 
A fervent member of the Strixhaven Iron-Lifters Society, she has already started to break long-held records in both powerlifting and weightlifting. When not training or competing (or occasionally studying), Greta spends her time in Bow’s End Tavern carousing. As beer isn’t free, she helps out at Strixhaven Stadium, setting up and putting away heavy equipment. Most people would begrudge the hard labor, but Greta happily does it. reasoning that she is being paid to work out. 
Greta makes a point to write regularly to her older brother, Grog, whom she misses terribly.
