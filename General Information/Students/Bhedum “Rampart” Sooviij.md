*Lawful Neutral Loxodon First Year (Lorehold)*
Since their name is difficult to pronounce without a trunk, Bhedum has taken to referring to themself as “Rampart,” the closest translation of their name in Common. They are often found poring over ancient texts detailing battles, seeking to better understand the tactical decisions that result in victory and defeat. Rampart is happy to discuss their knowledge with fellow members of the Dragonsguard Historical Society, often doing so late into the night. 
Rampart’s opponents at the Dragonchess Club find themselves outmatched time and again by the loxodon’s technique, though Rampart is a gracious winner. They attend all their classes clad in gilded, centuries-old plate armor, with an immense and similarly decorated sword strapped to their back. Rampart explains that doing so better simulates the battlefield conditions they study. 

**Pronouns.** They/Them

**Job.** None 
**Bond Boon.** Rampart’s commanding presence rubs off, and when you’re trying to avoid campus security, your fellow students always help you lie low. 
**Bond Bane.** Library books you need inexplicably go missing at key times, especially those about history. As a result, you can’t pull all-nighters.
