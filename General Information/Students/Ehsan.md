*Chaotic Good Leonin First Year (Witherbloom)*

Ehsan’s magical gifts bloomed late, meaning she is a good twenty or so years older than her peers. Those additional decades did not go to waste, however, as Ehsan is an excellent archer, forger, and all-around naturalist. 
As punctual and attentive in classes as she is, Ehsan appreciates her privacy from fellow students and faculty alike. With her worldly experience and keen senses, Ehsan has found a few places around campus where she can get away, whether it’s from the incessant rumour mill (students love gossip) or just to study alone. 
When not in seclusion, Ehsan can be found tending to the many grass fields on campus, or keeping herself in shape at the Stadium. She appreciates the friendly competition with her Iron-Lifters Society peers.
