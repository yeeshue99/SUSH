*Neutral Dhampir First Year (Witherbloom)*

Before arriving at Strixhaven, Aurora changed her name and appearance to that of her on-stage persona: Aurora Luna Wynterstarr, the brilliant singer and songwriter. Aurora was born a dhampir (a partial vampire), which she’s taken as a cosmic sign that she is meant for greatness. 

An accomplished musician on several instruments, Aurora is often found at Bow’s End Tavern performing beautiful dirges on the hurdy-gurdy for the assembled patrons. Aurora is also a member of the Strixhaven Show Band Association, though she believes the music they play lacks the raw emotion of her original compositions. 

She works as a groundskeeper at the Strixhaven Stadium, where she takes great pleasure in using magic to blight undesirable vegetation on the field.

**Bond Boon.** Out of respect for Aurora, fellow campus musicians will cover your expenses for one night per week at places where live music is common. 

**Bond Bane.** When there’s live music on campus, the lyrics always include rude sentiments directed toward you.
