The characters’ years at Strixhaven are covered by each of this book’s adventures, which focus on the notable and even shocking events that take place at the university. Even though the characters’ studies include the trappings of academic life—attending lectures, participating in labs, reading textbooks— those everyday academic activities mostly take place in the background. The exam rules presented here are thus designed to help the players keep their characters’ studies part of the game.

## Studying Phase
The Studying phase of an Exam represents the characters brushing up on their coursework, prompting sparks of insight when faced with difficult questions, or using mnemonics or other memorization techniques to absorb academic material. 

During the Studying phase, each character can opt into studying, choosing an ability score to augment their studying. They can use any ability and skill they wish when making this check, but they can make it only once. 

For example, one student might make an Intelligence (History) check to pore over their books, while another student makes a Charisma (Performance) check to create a series of spoken mnemonic devices. A third student might make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to create reminding gestures or practice any physical components that are part of a course, such as the somatic gestures involved in spellcasting. 

The character then gets a bonus for their exam taking, equal to the bonus associated with the roll.

### Normal Studying
By studying regularly, a character gains advantage on their exam taking.

### Pulling an All-Nighter
This encompasses all studying that is not regular enough to take up a time slot. This is described above.

### Studying Together
If two or more characters engage in a group study session, all characters involved gain a +1 for every roll that ended up positive.

### Skipping Studying
A character can skip the Studying phase if they wish, forgoing the chance of gaining these bonuses.

## Testing Phase
Once the Studying phase of an Exam is over, have the players record any rerolls their characters receive, then begin the Testing phase.

### Ability Checks
Each Exam’s Testing phase consists of two ability checks, with specifics (including the DC) noted in the encounter. If a character gained any rerolls during the Studying phase, the character can use them to reroll when making a Testing ability check, rerolling the check’s d20 and taking the highest of all rerolls for that check.

Each character’s Testing phase has three possible results: 

**Failed.** No successful ability checks means a character failed, having gotten fewer than half the questions correct. 
**Passed.** One successful ability check means a character passed, having gotten half or more of the questions correct, but not all the questions.
**Aced.** Two successful ability checks mean the character aced the Exam, having gotten all the questions correct.

### Cheating
An unscrupulous character can cheat on an Exam. Doing so requires a successful Charisma (Deception) check and a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, both using the DC set for the Exam. If a character cheats, they can’t use any rerolls from their Studying phase. 

If the character fails either of these checks, a proctor or other authority figure notices the cheating, and the student fails the exam. 

If the Charisma (Deception) and Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks are both successful, the character successfully cheats and aces the Exam.

### Failed Exam
If a character fails an Exam, Strixhaven’s bylaws require them to attend tutoring with a junior faculty member until they achieve at least a passed Exam in a different Exams encounter. This tutoring can be narrated through roleplaying, or you might simply inform the player of this result. 

A student who must attend tutoring can’t take part in any Extracurriculars or Jobs until they achieve at least a passed Exam during one of that academic year’s Exam encounters. The character thus loses any benefits from Extracurriculars or Jobs, and their player should indicate this suspension on their tracking sheet.
