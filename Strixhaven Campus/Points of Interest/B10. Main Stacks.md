Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill the center and the east end of the libraryâ€™s first floor, with the denser east stacks under a magic effect that shifts them when students approach, creating space to stand single-file between them. These books are mostly introductory texts, and first-year students are often directed here by their instructors. In each of these areas, two cogwork archivists busily shelve returned or misfiled books.
