In these quiet areas, students sit on the grass and study among lush foliage. Sometime last year, three awakened shrubs wandered in here and settled in each garden, and the university has welcomed them to stay.

Members of Witherbloom College typically tend this space, and up to three Witherbloom pledgemages can be found here most days. Members of the [[Fantastical Horticulture Club]] often relax in this area and hold meetings here from time to time.
