One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree’s roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural’s roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.

Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here with the cafe's manager, [[Aisla Fitzbottom]]. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.

The cafe always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies.
