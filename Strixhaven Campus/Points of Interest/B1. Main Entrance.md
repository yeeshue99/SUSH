Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door’s vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day. the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. Only the Biblioplex’s reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.
