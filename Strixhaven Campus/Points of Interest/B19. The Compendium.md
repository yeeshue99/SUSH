This area on the library’s third floor holds copies of most of the mundane, widely available written works in the multiverse. The books are inscrutably cataloged, so it’s almost impossible to find anything without requesting information from a reference librarian.

At the center of this area stands a statue depicting a mighty, benevolent dragon. The magical statue reads aloud the contents of most books placed in front of it if a character makes that request verbally or mentally.
