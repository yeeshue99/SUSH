This impressive stage is used for lectures, for assemblies, and as a gathering place in case of emergencies. Magic steps lead up to the stage from the floor of the library. Members of the [[Playactors Drama Guild]] often use this stage to meet and rehearse when [[The Rose Stage]] on Silverquillâ€™s campus is unavailable.
