Rooms on the Biblioplex’s second floor can be accessed only with keys held by faculty members, or that the reference librarians grant students on a case-by-case basis. Typically, students don’t receive keys to these stacks until they’re studying for their final thesis during their fourth year at Strixhaven. The arcane knowledge in the books here is not public—and is sometimes dangerous.

To prevent overly ambitious mages and Strixhaven’s enemies from teleporting into and accessing this area, two shield guardians patrol at all times. Students with permission to work here are given passwords by which the Constructs recognize them as friends.
