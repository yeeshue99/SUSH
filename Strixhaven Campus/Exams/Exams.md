The characters’ years at Strixhaven are covered by each of this book’s adventures, which focus on the notable and even shocking events that take place at the university. Even though the characters’ studies include the trappings of academic life—attending lectures, participating in labs, reading textbooks— those everyday academic activities mostly take place in the background. The exam rules presented here are thus designed to help the players keep their characters’ studies part of the game.

## Studying Phase
The Studying phase of an Exam represents the characters brushing up on their coursework, prompting sparks of insight when faced with difficult questions, or using mnemonics or other memorization techniques to absorb academic material. 

During the Studying phase, each character must succeed on an ability check against a DC noted in the encounter. They can use any ability and skill they wish when making this check, but they can make it only once. 

For example, one student might make an Intelligence (History) check to pore over their books, while another student makes a Charisma (Performance) check to create a series of spoken mnemonic devices. A third student might make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to create reminding gestures or practice any physical components that are part of a course, such as the somatic gestures involved in spellcasting. 

On a successful check, the character gains one reroll to use during the character’s next Testing phase.

### Pulling an All-Nighter
After pulling an all-nighter, a character gains two rerolls to use during the next Testing phase if the character succeeds on the ability check. Doing so imposes a cost: the character gains 1 level of exhaustion that takes effect at the start of the day of the Exam. This level of exhaustion can’t be removed until after the Exam.

### Studying Together
If two or more characters engage in a group study session, each participating character has advantage on their ability check during the Studying phase.

### Skipping Studying
A character can skip the Studying phase if they wish, forgoing the chance of gaining these rerolls.

## Testing Phase
Once the Studying phase of an Exam is over, have the players record any rerolls their characters receive, then begin the Testing phase.

### Ability Checks
Each Exam’s Testing phase consists of two ability checks, with specifics (including the DC) noted in the encounter. If a character gained any rerolls during the Studying phase, the character can use one reroll when making a Testing ability check, rerolling the check’s d20 and using the new roll. 

Each character’s Testing phase has three possible results: 

**Failed.** No successful ability checks means a character failed, having gotten fewer than half the questions correct. 
**Passed.** One successful ability check means a character passed, having gotten half or more of the questions correct, but not all the questions. The character gains one Student Die, explained below. 
**Aced.** Two successful ability checks mean the character aced the Exam, having gotten all the questions correct. The character gains two Student Dice, explained below.

### Cheating
An unscrupulous character can cheat on an Exam. Doing so requires a successful Charisma (Deception) check and a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, both using the DC set for the Exam. If a character cheats, they can’t use any rerolls from their Studying phase. 

If the character fails either of these checks, a proctor or other authority figure notices the cheating, and the student fails the exam. 

If the Charisma (Deception) and Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks are both successful, the character successfully cheats and aces the Exam.

### Failed Exam
If a character fails an Exam, Strixhaven’s bylaws require them to attend tutoring with a junior faculty member until they achieve at least a passed Exam in a different Exams encounter. This tutoring can be narrated through roleplaying, or you might simply inform the player of this result. 

A student who must attend tutoring can’t take part in any Extracurriculars or Jobs until they achieve at least a passed Exam during one of that academic year’s Exam encounters. The character thus loses any benefits from Extracurriculars or Jobs, and their player should indicate this suspension on their tracking sheet.
