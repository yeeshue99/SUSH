Originally a Quandrix professor of theory, this middle-aged vedalken now teaches a series of general studies courses that teaches students about the basics of the different casting schools of magic. While many of the Quandrix faculty focuses on advanced theory Orvlo has always been drawn to the basics of magical composition, particularly the fine details that make the different magical schools unique from one another. 

Orvlo typically teaches from the Biblioplex, where they spend most of their time. When not teaching they work as a volunteer librarian, using their skills to detect any spells students may have attempted to place on the tomes or scrolls and subsequently dispelling them of any such enchantments. They appreciate hard work and earnest study and frown on students who attempt jokes on them or who try to ingratiate themselves with them.
