*Neutral Orc Second Year (Witherbloom)*
First to class, last to leave, and always asking for additional homework, Urzmaktok is a meticulous student. Despite his consistently high marks, Urzmaktok makes no attempt to show off, although his studies seem rudimentary to him. Rumor has it that he is completing enough credits to earn multiple degrees when he graduates. 
Urzmaktok works for the Campus Magic Labs as a specimen preparer. This additional access to the labs also allows him to run his personal experiments in peace. Unsurprisingly, he is also a member of the Fantastical Horticulture Club. There, he looks to develop new species of plants that might yield new ingredients for potions. 
Urzmaktok makes it clear he wants everyone to use his full first name. Should anyone use a nickname, he won’t acknowledge the address.

**Bond Boon:** No matter the subject, you can always find a partner to study with, whether it’s Urzmaktok or a classmate doing him a favor.
**Bond Bane:** No one on campus who isn’t another player character will study with you. If you ask, most shrug decline, saying you'll probably fail.
