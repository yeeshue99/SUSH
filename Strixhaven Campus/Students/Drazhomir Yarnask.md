*Neutral Good Minotaur Second Year (Quandrix)*
Drazhomir is so soft-spoken that many of his peers must ask him to speak up to be understood. He is over seven feet tall, yet he continuously stoops, as if trying to occupy as little space as possible. Several activities and clubs that involve feats of strength and size continuously try to recruit him—to no avail. Drazhomir prefers spending his time in the Biblioplex. where he works as a book clerk, assisting students in finding required texts and shelving returns. He moves silently through the stacks, and he has given more than one student a scare when they’ve turned around to suddenly find him there. 
Drazhomir’s greatest love is poetry. As a member of the university’s Dead Languages Society, he scours ancient literature for stirring poems written in old tongues, reading them to the rest of the group in a soft, resonant voice that comes directly from his soul.

**Bond Boon:** Drazhomir writes you poetry, and the smile it puts on your face makes you likable to everyone on campus except the most stone-hearted. 
**Bond Bane:** Other students who work in the Biblioplex refuse to help you find any of the tomes you seek. Even the reference librarians are more cryptic.
