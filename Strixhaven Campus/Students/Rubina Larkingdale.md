*Lawful Neutral Human First Year (Silverquill)*
When Rubina walks into a room, people take notice. A measured performer with gravitas beyond her years, Rubina is a valued member of the Playactors Drama Guild who can handle weightier roles that more melodramatic actors can’t. This has caused friction within the guild as members vie for parts. Rubina’s stage presence extends to delivering presentations in class. When she orates, one can almost imagine a hardened general marshaling her bloodied and exhausted troops for a final push against a far superior foe. Rubina is part of the Strixhaven Show Band Association and has moved from playing to conducting. No previous student conductor has demanded and received such unwavering respect as Rubina. With merely a look and a raised eyebrow, she can quiet even the most raucous orchestra sections.

**Extracurriculars:** [[Playactors Drama Guild]], [[Strixhaven Show Band Association]]
**Job:** None 
**Bond Boon:** Rubina’s gravitas has rubbed off, and you can easily command an entire room’s attention. They hear your words favorably if you wish. 
**Bond Bane:** Whenever any band performs in public, its members stop and shake their heads in disapproval when they see you.
