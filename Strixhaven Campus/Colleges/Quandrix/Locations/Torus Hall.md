The central hall of Quandrix campus lies at the end of a geometric series of walkways, terminating at ascending ramps to the towering building. Inside. Torus Hall’s architecture is mapped to an ever-changing three-dimensional grid, which slowly evolves. Some Quandrix faculty members insist that mage-students shouldn’t linger too long inside the hall, lest its geometry eventually turn itself inside out while students are still within it.
