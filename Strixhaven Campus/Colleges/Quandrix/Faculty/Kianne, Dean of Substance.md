Brilliant and eccentric, Dean Kianne (neutral elf Quandrix professor of substance) is one of the preeminent mana scholars of the world. She has visited and studied countless bizarre magical phenomena, from snarls to star arches to ancient shrines. She loves to share her wild theories with anyone who will listen. 

Kianne believes in using mathematics to better understand nature. She places an emphasis on practical magic that improves daily life through applied calculations. She rolls her eyes at [[Imbraham, Dean of Theory|Dean Imbrahamâ€™s]] theories, dismissing them as evidence that her fellow dean lives in an imaginary world.
