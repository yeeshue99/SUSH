Deekah (lawful neutral human Quandrix professor of theory) sees the world as an endless sequence of interconnected equations, which to her is the most beautiful thing imaginable. She explores new theorems by giving them physical form, and her exquisite geometric creations are thrilling sights on campus.

The schools of Fractology and Vivifying have opposing principles but both focus on the summoning of fractals. True to her title, Deekah tends to spend more time focusing on the theory in class but will occasionally teach students how to summon actual fractal creatures in order to show the class how useful theory can be when applied to substance. Deekah is out of touch at times, sometimes losing her train of thought during lectures when she has a side thought about a particularly interesting theorem or idea. She is commonly seen with a living theorem trailing alongside her, computing away at one of her many hypotheses while she goes about her day to day life.
