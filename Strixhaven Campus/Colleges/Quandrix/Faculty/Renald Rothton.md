![[Renald.webp|300]]

Renald was born to an influential and magically gifted human noble family. Throughout his formative years he was raised to carry on the family's legacy. That plan had a few issues when it was discovered Renald could barely use magic at all. As a result of this discovery, Renald's mother hired a wizard to tutor Renald in magic, dismissing rumors about the man's past and his often cruel teaching methods. Renald's life was tragically lost during a lesson gone awry. 

And then he came back. Only a few hours later, long after his heart stopped pumping blood through his body Renald awoke. As he sat up and looked around he started seeing equations, diagrams, and other such information about whatever he was looking at. Fearing the work of a dark presence, the tutor attempted to kill the young boy with magic Renald now found weak and meaningless. The young boy who could hardly cast a spell instinctively changed the laws of the natural world, crushing the bones of the tutor in a powerful gravity well. Upon learning what had happened Renald's parents wrote to Strixhaven and begged for early admission to be granted to their son, which Strixhaven approved. 

Now nearing his 19th birthday, Renald is one of the youngest individuals to ever be granted a professorship at Strixhaven. While some are off put by his pale skin and empty stare that never quite meets your gaze (as he glances at the equations and diagrams only he can see) none can refuse his brilliance with reality-bending abstraction magic.
