Ruxa (neutral good Quandrix professor of substance) looks like a bipedal brown bear and knows that wild new theories, though exciting, are worthless without a deep understanding of the basics. He teaches students of all levels, and even his most experienced pupils benefit from a much deeper understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the world.

Ruxa has a deep, melodic voice and students often wonder if he's the one who is patient or if patience is a requirement of having him as a professor. The faculty, however, know that Ruxa is a godsend as none of them want to teach the basics to a bunch of first-years, preferring instead to spend their time on more exciting things. Ruxa takes this in stride and doubles down on drilling the basics of the introductory classes he teaches into his students.
