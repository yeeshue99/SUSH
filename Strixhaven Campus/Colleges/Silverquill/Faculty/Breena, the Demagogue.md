Breena (neutral good owlin Silverquill professor of shadow) has a talent for getting her way. If she wants you to do something, you won’t just do it—you’ll be sure it was your idea all along. Her students and colleagues alike hang on her every word, and in front of a crowd, she’s a powerhouse of charisma. Though she’s an elite mage who can easily hold her own in a fight, Breena prefers to defeat her foes with words alone.
