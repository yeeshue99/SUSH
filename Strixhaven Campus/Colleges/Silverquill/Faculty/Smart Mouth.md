As a Kenku, Smart Mouth isn't what most people think of when they think of a master of word magic. Victim to the same ancient curse that afflicts all of his people, Smart Mouth can only duplicate sounds he's heard before. However, with a genius level intellect and a perfect memory Smart Mouth is able to draw upon and duplicate every single word, phrase, and sound he's ever heard before. This tended to land him in trouble at a young age when other individuals would try to pick on him only to discover he was always ready with a perfect and witty comeback. On one particular day he was told he should watch his smart mouth before it landed him in real trouble and thus he adopted the name Smart Mouth. 

This Silverquill professor of radiance knows more than anyone that words can be magical and that choosing exactly the right word can enhance both meaning and magic exponentially. He teaches students about various words of power and about the importance of syntax and word choice in verbal spells. Most of his exams are oral and he has students read their homework aloud in class in order to both critique their word choices and to build his repository of sounds and phrases.
