Dean Embrose Lu (lawful neutral human Silverquill professor of shadow) is a master poet whose ink magic is merciless. Scant with praise and quick with a cutting remark, Dean Lu has seen many mage-students scrub out of Strixhaven and has nothing good to say about those who can’t hack it. 

A cynic, Embrose believes that most people are in it for themselves. He demands his students learn how to use language-based magic to “get what they deserve.” While he often argues with Dean Talonrook, he holds a deep (if begrudging) respect for the owlin.
