Brenneth Blackstone (lawful evil tiefling Silverquill professor of shadow) is a talented and dedicated duskmage. Some may say that he may delve a little too deep into the shadows, but he simply has a curiosity for what lies beyond a shadow. He teaches a course in scrivening and scriptology that students take over the course of their second year.
