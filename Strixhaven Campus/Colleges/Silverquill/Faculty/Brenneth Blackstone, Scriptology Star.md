Brenneth Blackstone (neutral good dhampir Silverquill professor of shadow) is a rising star in the study of magical writing and symbols. With a dynamic lecturing style, this dhampir—a partial vampire—attracts students from across Strixhaven purely for his lessons’ value as performance art. He teaches a course in scrivening and scriptology that characters take over the course of their second year.
