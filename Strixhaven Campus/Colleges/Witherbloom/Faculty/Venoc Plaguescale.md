As a green dragonborn who has always been afflicted with various illnesses, Venoc has never found much acceptance in the world. Which is just fine with him because for all he cares the world can suffer with him. Venoc's primary goal in life is to create increasingly powerful diseases using Banelock magic. If he can create just the right concoction he can spread a disease that will cause others to suffer just as much as he has. 

As a Witherbloom professor of decay Venoc is barely interested in his students or their studies unless they're a prodigy. Venoc is really only at Strixhaven for the access to research and materials. He absolutely hates Asana, whom he considers to be a rival who is always getting in his way by coming up with cures for his diseases. The two professors tend to draw their students into their rivalry as well. Venoc pays students for any dangerous spell components they find and encourages them to bring back information about Asana's cures and other research.
