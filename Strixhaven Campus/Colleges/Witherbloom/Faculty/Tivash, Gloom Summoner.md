It’s tough to study the secrets of life and death without getting your hands dirty—which is the first thing Tivash (neutral human Witherbloom professor of decay) teaches Witherbloom students. Some call the forces he manipulates evil, but he asserts that power is only as good or evil as how you use it.

Tivash is a death mage who focuses more on destructive death magics rather than the reanimation work of Professor Onyx. Tivash has little patience for students except for those who suck up to him. 

As a powerful death mage, Tivash commonly uses pests to fuel his work, a feat frowned upon for those who favor the adorable creatures. Tivash has occasionally needed extra fuel for more powerful spells and has no problem substituting his own life energy. Because of this his entire left hand and arm are shriveled, completely black, and entirely unusable. Tivash considers this a minor obstacle on his path to greatness as he merely uses magic to do things his left arm used to do. Tivash teaches a general studies course on using magic to solve such problems for those students brave enough to have him as a teacher.
