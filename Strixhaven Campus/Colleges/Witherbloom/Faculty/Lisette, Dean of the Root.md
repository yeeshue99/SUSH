Dean Lissette (neutral good human Witherbloom professor of growth) is a world-class healer and herbalist; it’s even said she once cured the Lorehold founder dragon of a secret illness. Lisette’s classes lean more toward demonstration and hands-on experience than lectures. When Lisette speaks, her words are soft and full of colorful metaphors. 

Lisette believes in preserving nature and life, and she instills in her students a respect for all living things. While [[Valentin, Dean of the Vein|Dean Valentin’s]] exploitation of living creatures disgusts her, she also knows she can use the results of his cruelty to help future lives.
