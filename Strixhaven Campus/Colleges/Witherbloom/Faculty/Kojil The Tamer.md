Even as a young firbolg Kojil always had a way with animals. At only seven years old he helped calm a mad squirrel, foaming at the mouth, for long enough to find the wound that had caused the disease. Unable to heal the creature, the village elder helped the squirrel pass on. However, instead of passing on, the spirit of the squirrel remained and quickly climbed up to Kojil's shoulder.

In the years to follow Kojil either tamed or was approached by all manner of dangerous or rare creatures such as Karoks and Cervins and was visited at times by the spirits of other creatures as well. The village elder wrote to Strixhaven about these feats, hoping for an explanation and receiving only an admission letter for young Kojil in return. 

Kojil now serves as a Witherbloom professor of growth with his faithful squirrel ghost/familiar, whom he calls Tall Ear. Despite the dangers of Sedgemoor and the Detention Bog, Kojil teaches students how to connect with the fauna of the land and how to use that connection to feel a creature's thoughts, desires, and even fears, allow his charges to form a bond with the creature. He also shows that even in death creatures can still be called upon and works with the spirits of pests and other creatures who die in the classes taught by other professors. Sometimes these spirits don't want to serve and sometimes spells can call on other forces, so Kojil teaches all students how to send dangerous entities back to where they came from.
