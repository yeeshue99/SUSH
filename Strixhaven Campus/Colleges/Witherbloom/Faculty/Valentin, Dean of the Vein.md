![[Dean_of_Decay.jpg|300]]

Dean Valentin (neutral vampire) is ancient and drinks the blood of living creatures throughout the bayou. Valentin is a kind of sangromancer—he receives visions from the blood he consumes, which he uses to learn things about a creature or place. He has no qualms about exploiting the bayou’s creatures for personal gain.

Valentin's classes focus on dissection and decay. He and [[Lisette, Dean of the Root|Dean Lisette]] often clash over his cavalier treatment of animals, but that hasn’t stopped her from using his discoveries for her research.
