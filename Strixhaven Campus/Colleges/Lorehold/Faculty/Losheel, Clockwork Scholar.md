Losheel (chaotic good loxodon Lorehold professor of chaos) is a Humanoid resembling a bipedal elephant. She proudly admits that she is willing to work hard to be as lazy as possible. She turns her brilliant mind to constructing increasingly efficient mechanical helpers, with the goal of one day being able to do anything she wants without standing up.

She is credited with creating Cleaner, which is just salt in the wound for her, and she considers Cleaner to be her greatest failure since it won't come back and clean her quarters for her. Losheel is looking forward to a peaceful retirement where she rules over her flock of automatons in comfort.
