![[Dean_of_Order.jpg|300]]

Augusta Tullus (lawful neutral human Lorehold professor of order) is the current Dean of Order. A professor of spirit studies, she has been called the college’s most talented pastraiser. She can conjure entire legions of ghostly apparitions to reenact historical events for her lectures. 

Augusta believes that history repeats itself as an orderly progression toward an ideal. In her view, the mistakes of the past can inform the choices of the present, creating a world of peace and order. She plays things by the book and frowns on students who embark on [[Plargg, Dean of Chaos|Dean Plargg’s ]] dangerous field trips.
