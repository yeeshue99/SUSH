![[lianna.webp|300]]
Lianna is an older female high elf and a semi-retired member of the Dragonsguard. As an official Dragonsguard member, she's accepted a teaching position at the school to both impart her knowledge and to scope out potential recruitable talent. Lianna's knowledge of the Founder Dragons is vast, and she only lets her guard down when discussing the Founders or the Dragonsguard. Otherwise, she is typically stiff and formal, a byproduct of her military experience. She teaches two classes on the Founders and one class on Warsinging, a field in which she is considered an expert. 

Rumor has it that Lianna attended Strixhaven many, many years ago and attended Lorehold college. She was more happy-go-lucky and spontaneous in her youth. Unfortunately, a careless expedition into a newly discovered ruin led to the death of her best friend. [[Velomachtus Lorehold]] himself helped Lianna find a new path with the Dragonsguard. Because of her past, Lianna is drawn to chaotic, reckless, and headstrong students out of an almost motherly and protective instinct. Consequently, she can come across as overbearing or nosy in her concern for them.
