Xyla is a relatively young, female gnome. Sheâ€™s a prominent dustspeaker and one of the newest Lorehold professors of order. At a young age, Xyla grew frustrated over people always misspelling or mispronouncing her name. To combat this, she took it upon herself to learn as many languages as she possibly could. That way, at least she knew she would never make the same mistake. Despite her young age, Xyla is fluent in nearly twice the number of languages as the next most linguistically focused faculty member at Strixhaven. 

Xyla particularly enjoys researching new and obscure languages and can become overly excited when she meets a student who knows an uncommon or rare language. Like many gnomes, Xyla has an abundant love of life but much of her time is spent listening to ancient spirits bound to statues on Effigy Row. Xyla teaches several courses on language and composition of magical tomes, grimoires, and scrolls.
