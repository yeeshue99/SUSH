Even by Lorehold standards, Osgir (neutral stone giant) is obsessed with relics of the past. A professor of order, he treasures every connection to old civilizations, whether it’s a magnificent jeweled crown or an old shovel. As a student, he constantlyspent time in detention for hoarding the best finds from Lorehold dig sites in his room; he lost count of how many times he was sternly told. "History belongs to us all!’’ 

So, naturally, he mastered the magical art of duplicative restoration. Not only can he perfectly recreate an ancient object or device from the smallest scrap, but he can also produce a second, identical version for his personal collection. He displays something different every week in his Lorehold office, from a mighty sword of demon-slaying to a delicate elven music box.
