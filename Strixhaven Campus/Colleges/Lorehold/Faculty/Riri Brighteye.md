Hardly ever seen without her Bottle of Boundless Coffee in one hand, Lorehold professor of order Riri Brighteye is a female owlin who can be found at all hours. Some students speculate that she never sleeps, and her eyes twitch frequently as if to confirm that rumor. Professor Brighteye is perpetually energetic, despite spending much of her time pouring over ancient tomes. 

She can go days or weeks with the same volume in her search to find important details others may have missed. She balances the conflicting sides of being a Chaos Scholar who pursues the tiniest details with her Archaeoscribe side in order to record those details for others to find more easily. One of the only times where Riri isn't found in her office or at the Firejolt Cafe is during Mage Tower games where her caffeine-fueled lifestyle allows her to cheer at the same level as the most enthusiastic students.
