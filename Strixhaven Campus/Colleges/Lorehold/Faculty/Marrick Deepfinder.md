Marrick is a dashingly handsome male halfling and Lorehold professor of chaos. He's well known for his impressive archeological finds and his willingness to dive headfirst into fresh ruins. He's forever looking to test his luck against trapped doors, chests, halls, etc. And as he tells anyone who will listen, it's always his lucky day. He tends to come out on top, both in his expeditions and his business dealings. 

Marrick and the other Lorehold staff agree that artifacts should be owned and maintained by the community at large. That said, Marrick personally believes that dangerous artifacts, especially ones that might hurt students or staff, should be moved into more private collections...for the right price. Marrick might readily accompany students who wish to go ruin-diving for artifacts, but he gets selfish about splitting up the finds. His selfishness only extends to profit though as he readily puts himself into danger to help students out of tough situations.
