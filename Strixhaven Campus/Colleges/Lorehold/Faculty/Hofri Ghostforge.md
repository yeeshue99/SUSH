When Hofri (neutral good dwarf Lorehold professor of order) first enrolled in Strixhaven. he believed his future lay with Prismari. A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills of art, but his magic left something to be desired. After talking with the school’s counselor, Mavinda, Hofri decided to try his luck with Lorehold. It turned out he had a natural talent for Lorehold’s spirit magic. 

His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritu. I sense, Hofri could visualize a spirit's mortal app< ance and construct a viable statue form for them inhabit. No one in Lorehold's history had previous: created a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri w; offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted.
