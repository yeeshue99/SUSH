Arkin (lawful good human Prismari professor of expression) is a newly hired instructor teaching a few courses in choreography and dance ensembles. He recently graduated from Strixhaven himself, and he bubbles with excitement at the prospect of guiding a new generation of students on the course of study he so greatly enjoyed. He particularly delights in finding new ways to help students work collaboratively to unlock the heights of their creative potential. 

Arkin loves the sport of Mage Tower and loves the school spirit behind mascots. He teaches a course on summoning mascots for students who want a little friend following them around. As the book described, Arkin focuses a lot on cooperation and so the homework for both of his classes is typically either partner or group-themed.
