Rock is a handsome, middle-aged, male, earth genasi and a Prismari professor of expression. Abandoned as an infant, Rock was found by a human farmer who turned him over to a local monastery where he was raised in the ways of the monks. In his adolescence Rock struggled with the principles of the monastery, often having emotional outbursts, and creating loud noises that went against the teachings of the monks. Sensing that Rock's path was not with them, the head of the monastic order arranged for his invitation to Strixhaven. There, the young genasi flourished.

During his second year at Strixhaven, Rock stumbled upon a *Cli Lyre* and discovered his natural talent with music. Not knowing what the instrument was, Rock initially believed the powers he gained from the lyre were his own. He enjoyed using the fly, invisibility, stone shape, wall of fire, and wind wall spells during concerts. He has since learned what the Lyre is and continues to enjoy its powers when he performs once or twice each school year. 

He earned the nickname "Earsplitter" during his 4th year after enchanting his lyre with a thaumaturgy-like effect that greatly enhances the sounds it produces. Rock's concerts are held in high regard by students and faculty alike and typically take place in Strixhaven Arena as it's the only facility large enough to house the audience. 

Despite being a famous campus presence, Rock has a "strong, silent type" personality and prefers to let his music speak for him. Honestly, it's difficult to carry a conversation with the stoic genasi. Even so, many enamored students and faculty alike have tried throughout the years. Rock makes every attempt to attend his student's performances, whether scheduled or impromptu. He's always ready with both praise and critiques. Rock is willing to mentor budding musicians outside of class but only if they're a Prismari student.
