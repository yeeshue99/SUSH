Many Prismari might lose control of their emotions and others attempt to suppress them. Veyra actively straddles that line. Instead of focusing on powerful, negative emotions however she chooses to focus on joy and happiness. Students can often find her wandering around the Prismari campus with cute elementals based off of dogs, squirrels, rabbits, and other adorable creatures that give students warm nuzzles. 

Because of her personality Veyran's art typically expresses bright popping colors. She uses a variety of different elements in her spells and has even been known to use illusion magic during live performances for extra-special effects. Veyran never forgets a face and makes a point to keep in touch with students who take her classes.

In addition to being an accomplished elementalist, Veyran (chaotic good genasi Prismari professor of perfection) serves as a mentor to many Prismari pledgemages. She advocates enthusiastically for the importance of both passion and disciplined technique in any artistic pursuit. If a new student is upset or overwhelmed, she eagerly calls forth playful, beautiful elemental creatures to cheer up the student.
