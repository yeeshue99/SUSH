As a female summer eladrin, Ignaria is accustomed to getting what she wants. And what she wants most is for students to not call her "professor" or even "Ignaria". Preferring to go by Iggy, this Prismari professor of expression can sometimes be too hot to handle. She is a skilled fire user whose volatile emotions serve as fuel for her magic. Regardless of their relationship, Iggy is always up front and brutally honest with students. Other faculty and individuals can always tell when she's heating up about something because her hair will start to glow and will give off a small amount of smoke. 

For students who are passionate hard workers, Iggy is one of the best professors they'll ever have. For those who lack ambition, motivation, or natural talent, Iggy can be an overwhelming force who lights a fire (sometimes literally) under them to drive them towards success. 

As a dancer, Iggy often does partner performances with [[Zeph]]. His mastery over wind and gusts greatly enhances her flames. The two balance each other well off the stage too. Zeph's calmness helps to balance Iggy's hot headedness. They're in a budding relationship, though they try to keep this secret from students. However, those who are close to either of them know about it.
