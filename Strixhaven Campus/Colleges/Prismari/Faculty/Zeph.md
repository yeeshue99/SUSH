Zeph was born Zephria, a female air genasi. However, as Zephria matured her identity felt like more of a prison and she eventually transitioned to identifying as a male named Zeph. No longer feeling shackled, Zeph's air magic flourished and he was offered a position as a Prismari professor of perfection. For the most part, Zeph is a calm and collected individual. He's easy to spot around campus in self-made, overly loose clothing. As both a martial artist and a self proclaimed "movement performer," the loose clothing allows Zeph freedom to stretch and contract his body in myriad ways. Devoted to his craft, Zeph's personality only really changes when frustrated. This can be seen if he loses balance or is otherwise unable to perfect a certain technique. 

Zeph's method of fighting appears to combine jabs and kicks with various dance moves. When observed by passerby along the Opus Walk, Zephâ€™s training appears as a performance unto itself. When not teaching or training, Zeph enjoys climbing to the top of Conjurot Hall and jumping off, using his specially designed clothes to catch and ride the strong gusts around campus.
