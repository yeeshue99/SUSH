Extracurriculars—the campus clubs and societies students can join—are a key part of student life at Strixhaven. Using the rules that follow, characters can join Extracurriculars to add flavor to the book’s adventures, gain minor rules benefits, and perhaps more easily befriend—or irritate—their classmates.

## Joining an Extracurricular
At any point during the book’s adventures, a character can gain the benefit of two of the Extracurriculars noted below, as described later in this section. If a student character also works on campus using the Job rules, the character can benefit from only one Extracurricular. 

Characters can gain the benefit from a new Extracurricular only by joining it at the start of an academic year, which corresponds to the beginning of a new adventure. Typically, joining an Extracurricular in between academic years isn’t eventful. Players should note the changes on their tracking sheet.

## Extracurricular Benefits
While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

### Student Dice
Each character gains one Student Die for each Extracurricular they are participating in. A Student Die is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the skills listed in the Extracurricular’s description. The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can't roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.

### Relationship Point
While a student participates in an Extracurricular, the student gains either a positive or a negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC who is also a member of the Extracurricular (see the [[Relationship rules]]).

## Quitting an Extracurricular
Characters can quit an Extracurricular at any time, updating their tracking sheet accordingly. When a student quits an Extracurricular, they immediately lose its benefits. If a character quits during an adventure, you might want to roleplay the situation, since NPCs are likely to take an interest in why the student is leaving.
