Working in gainful employment while at school can provide a character with a modicum of cash and help forge connections with student coworkers.

## Getting or Losing a Job
A character can hold one Job at a time, and they can participate in only one Extracurricular while they have a Job. A student can switch Jobs whenever they wish, even in the middle of the academic year, as long as they don’t work more than one Job at a time. At your discretion, switching Jobs in the middle of the year might lead to a roleplaying scenario.

## Job Benefits
While a student has a Job, they earn a wage and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

### Wage
A student who works a Job gains 5 gp at the start of each week that they hold the Job. If a student quits during the academic year, they stop earning this money at the end of the week in which they quit.

### Relationship Point
While a character works a Job, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC at that Job. This represents a coworker with whom the character is often scheduled and with whom they can easily form a connection (see the [[Relationship rules]]).
