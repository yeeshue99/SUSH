Strixhaven occupies hundreds of acres, spread out over six campuses. Each of the university’s five colleges has its own campus, and the central campus, home to the Biblioplex and Strixhaven Stadium, serves as a hub for university life. See the appendix or the poster map for a view of the entire university. Well-maintained roads connect the six campuses, and walking from one to another can take a halfhour or more. Regular shuttles—large carriages drawn by horselike automata—run on an hourly schedule between a station near the Biblioplex and each of the satellite campuses, making the journey in about 15 minutes. In addition, each campus has multiple permanent teleportation circles, which faculty and more advanced students can use when they require instantaneous travel, and several magical portals exist as well. These portals can be unpredictable: they aren’t necessarily open all the time, they don’t always lead to the same places, and some require complicated conditions or keys to open.
