The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university’s main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat. 

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolizing the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

**Ceilings.** The ceilings throughout the first floor of the Biblioplex are 50 feet high. The second- and third-floor ceilings are 30 feet high. 
**Magic Stairs.** As in all Strixhaven buildings, the stairs and steps leading into and within the Biblioplex are enchanted to move and reshape for full accessibility. See the "Strixhaven Accessibility" sidebar. 
**Transport Circles.** A runic circle is painted on the floor near each staircase in the Biblioplex, as well as at the top and bottom of the steps leading to the main entrance in area Bl. These circles are permanent, customized teleportation circles. When a user moves onto a circle and mentally focuses on the floor to which they wish to travel, they are transported to the destination floor, arriving at that floor’s runic circle for that staircase. (Students are all aware that entering the second floor is forbidden without permission from a faculty member.) The circle at the bottom of the front steps transports users to the circle at the top of the steps and vice versa. 
**Students and Professors.** Students of all years and colleges can be found in the Biblioplex. as can professors from all the colleges. See chapter 7 for stat blocks for first-year students, and for apprentices, pledgemages, and professors from the different colleges.
