At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside the Biblioplex stands the cozy Firejolt Cafe, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The cafeâ€™s name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for firstyear students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.
