Headed by Lord Julian L'Mann, the L'Mann family came to power through the development of the [[L'Mann Family Sword Arts]]. Julian L'Mann passes his techniques to his children through a harsh and grueling training from birth. He places no emphasis on age or gender, and prioritizes only strength, vowing to pass on the L'Mann family to the strongest of his children.

Penelope is the oldest child, followed by Alexander, Audrey, and Evi.
