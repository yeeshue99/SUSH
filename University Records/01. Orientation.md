All 6 students arrive, and are corralled by the campus guide bot into a nearby area, where they are assigned to be Orientation Group D. Once all members of group D have arrived, the guide leads them inside where they have a chance to explore the cafe and student store. At the cafe, the students meet a very kind human named [[Aisla Fitzbottom|Aisla]], where they purchase some coffee and refreshments. The guide then leads them further into [[The Biblioplex|the Biblioplex]] where they are introduced to its many locations and services. They break for an hour to explore on their own. [[Kamisato Ayaka]] and [[Samo Jere]] preferred to be by themselves. [[Kamisato Ayato]] goes to the art gallery to listen to [[Nora Ann Wu|Nora's]] lecture on art. [[Gabimaru Narumi]], [[Rae Mistle]], and [[Caysili]] chat up two students named [[Ehsan]] and [[Aurora Luna Wynterstarr|Aurora.]]
After the hour passes, the group reconvenes at the Hall of Oracles to play an icebreaker and receive their scavenger hunt clues. They solve each one diligently, and as they celebrate their success, large chests grow in size, turning into monsters. Group D leaps into action, throwing fear to the wayside.

Three of their group are knocked aside almost immediately. However, the friends that they had made that day storm onto the scene, to help them defeat the creatures. A professor comes to make sure everyone is safe, and then gave everyone involved a wondrous prize befitting their valor.
