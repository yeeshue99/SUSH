Beginning their first day of classes, Group D gather to meet professor [[Verelda Lang, Arcano-Biologist|Verelda Lang]], where they learn the dangers and cautions of dealing with Ankhegs. Some students arrive earlier than others, and [[Kamisato Ayato|Ayato]] uses the opportunity to get his flirt on, hitting it off immediately with [[Cadoras Damellawar|Cad]]. After a long first day of classes, a buzz spreads throughout the students at [[The Biblioplex]], and Group D is pulled into the excitement towards the [[Firejolt Cafe]], where some students found some frogs and set up a frog racing ring in the back of the cafe. [[Rae Mistle|Rae]], [[Gabimaru Narumi|Gabi]], [[Salem]], and [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]] all become coaches for their frogs, dressing them up in a dress, a suit, a top hat, and a sword, respectively. Gabi, [[Caysili|Sisi]], and Ayato all put down money, but unfortunately none of them won. Salem, as the winner of the race, won a sizable chunk of money, and an adorable little friend. This friendship did not last long, as all four of their frogs grew in size, attacking Group D. Rae manages to almost instantly subdue her frog, Squirtle, but the same could not be said for the others. Ayato bravely calls the aggro on all frogs once he saw his friends in danger, but the frogs were quite lethal indeed, pulling him down instantly. In a rage, Ayaka crushes her frog, Sword, into frog mush, while Gabi and Salem manage to calm down their frogs, Julio and Dipper, respectively.
