Wondrous item, common

This candle sheds light comparable to that produced by a [light](https://5e.tools/spells.html#light_phb) spell. An _everbright candle sheds light in a 40-foot radius; the closest 20 feet is bright light, and the farthest 20 feet is dim light.

The candle can be turned on and off using buttons on the side. By turning a small dial on the bottom, the candle's color will change as well.
