Associated Rolls: Athletics, Acrobatics, Dexterity Saves

In this class students are taught by Instructor [[Arkin Minexes, Peppy Instructor|Arkin]], a male orc, the basics of moving effectively. By controlling their bodies students can move faster and can avoid being touched by enemies they're close to. Due to the high value Arkin places on cooperation the homework in this class is almost always either partner or group exercises.
