Associated Skills: Arcana, Medicine, Nature

This introductory course is taught by the Witherbloom deans, [[Lisette, Dean of the Root|Lisette]] and [[Valentin, Dean of the Vein|Valentin]]. This course contains a large number of students, it is lecture-based with no time for questions and answers, and it is very confusing due to the dichotomous nature of the deans. In this course students will learn what Witherbloom is all about by learning how to respect and embrace nature and how to harness the abundant life energies found in nature for personal power.
