[[Willowdusk, Essence Seer|Willowdusk]] started teaching this class nearly a century ago after finding one too many corpses of individuals who harvested a dangerous and misidentified spell component. In this class Willowdusk takes students on patrol with her and points out the small, difficult to miss details that separate perfectly benign ingredients from far more dangerous ones. Exams require students to correctly identify a set number of samples. Those who pass learn how to use some of these dangerous components in new ways.
