Associated Rolls: Arcana, Intelligence, Nature

This introductory course is taught by the Quandrix deans, [[Kianne, Dean of Substance|Kianne]] and [[Imbraham, Dean of Theory|Imbraham]]. This course contains a large number of students, it is lecture-based with no time for questions and answers, and it is very confusing due to the dichotomous nature of the deans. In this course students will learn what Quandrix is all about by delving into complicated and unsolvable theories and then seeing how tweaking equations can enhance magic and create a more comfortable daily life.
