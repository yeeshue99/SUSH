Associated Skills: History, Perception, Performance

This introductory course is taught by the Prismari deans, [[Uvilda Mistcoiler, Dean of Perfection|Uvilda Mistcoiler]] and [[Nassari, Dean of Expression|Nassari]]. This course contains a large number of students, it is lecture based with no time for questions and answers, and it is very confusing due to the dichotomous nature of the deans. In this course students will learn what Prismari is all about through an exploration of historic art, both masterpieces and chaotic pop-up exhibits.
