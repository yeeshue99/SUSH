[[Venoc Plaguescale]] has little patience for students, especially new students. To those who wish to learn the secrets of being a Banelock and how to drain life and wither nature he says "prove it". In this class Venoc does some "hands on" teaching where he throws blight magic at students in an effort to make them drop the class.
