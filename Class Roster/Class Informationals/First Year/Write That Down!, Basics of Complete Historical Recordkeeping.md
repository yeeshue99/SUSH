[[Riri Brighteye]], a female Owlin and Lorehold professor of order, teaches students in this introductory class that relevance is in the eye of the reader and as such the only homework she assigns is to maintain a thorough diary every single day. She stresses not to include private details in the diaries as she reads them at the end of term but to otherwise include even the most mundane notes so that historians can choose their own relevant information from the many long pages. While this initial course leans more towards the principle of Chaos it serves as the foundation for her more advanced courses that examine details of ancient civilizations that are often overlooked.
