Associated Rolls: Charisma Saves, Persuasion, Spell Attacks

This introductory course is taught by the Silverquill deans, [[Shaile Talonrook, Dean of Radiance|Shaile Talonrook]] and [[Embrose Lu, Dean of Shadow|Embrose Lu]]. This course contains a large number of students, it is lecture-based with no time for questions and answers, and it is very confusing due to the dichotomous nature of the deans. In this course students will learn what Silverquill is all about by witnessing firsthand the power of prose and the protection offered by projection.
