Associated Rolls: History, Investigation, Various Tools

Students might be initially confused about the location of this class as it is one of the few that doesn't take place in a lecture hall or classroom. Instead this class takes place in the workshop of [[Osgir, the Reconstructor]], a Lorehold professor of order. These classes can be frequently interrupted by messengers or students bringing him new finds. Osgir welcomes the interruptions as it gives him a new artifact to show his students. Osgir's love for artifacts of all kinds is plainly apparent and he has historically been moved to give extra credit to students who bring him new artifacts.
