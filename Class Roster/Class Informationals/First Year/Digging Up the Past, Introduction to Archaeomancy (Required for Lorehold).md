As an introductory course to the college this class is taught by Lorehold's deans, [[Augusta Tullus, Dean of Order|Augusta Tullus]] and [[Plargg, Dean of Chaos|Plargg]]. This course contains a large number of students, it is lecture-based with no time for questions and answers, and it is very confusing due to the dichotomous nature of the deans. In this course students will learn what Lorehold is all about through an exploration of various methods of record-keeping and exploration tactics.
