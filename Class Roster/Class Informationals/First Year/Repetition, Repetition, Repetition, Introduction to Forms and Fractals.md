Associated Rolls: Insight, Intelligence, Nature

[[Deekah, Fractal Theorist|Professor Deekah]] shares her love of math and fractology in this introductory class. Students learn to conjure their own living theorems in class and as homework use the theorems to compute complex equations. Grades are given not on complete answers but on how quickly the theorems are able to solve the equations. Passing this class teaches students how to cast Vortex Warp to use fractals to move themselves or others through space.
